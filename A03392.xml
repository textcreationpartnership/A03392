         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And on <hi>Gal. 4.27.</hi> he alſo ſaith, As it is the moſt principall and ſpeciall article of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, To know that we are iuſtified and ſaued by Chriſt: ſo is it alſo very neceſſary to know and vnderſtand well the doctrine concerning the aboliſhment of the Law, for it helpeth very much to confirme our doctrine as touching faith, and to attaine to ſound and certaine conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of conſcience, when we are aſſured that the Law is aboliſhed, and eſpecially in great terrors and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.
<pb facs="tcp:16702:3"/> Thus far <hi>Luther:</hi> who as you ſee agreeth with mee, that the point is of great conſequence, and very neceſſary to be knowne of all that truly ſeeke Chriſt Ieſus. I will ſet you downe as briefly as I can, what I conceiue, and ſome teſtimonies for the ſame that are briefe, and point you to ſome others that are more large. The point is this: <hi>In the Church of Chriſt ſince his death the whole Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>is wholly aboliſhed, or abrogated.</hi> For as ſaith <hi>Toſſanus</hi> in <hi>2 Cor. 3.

               <hi>1.</hi> The whole Epiſtle to the Galatians importeth ſo much, for it is the generall argument of that Epiſtle. And that there is meant the Morall law as well as any other, in <hi>Gal. 3.19.23.</hi>
               <note place="margin">See alſo <hi>Calu. Iuſt.</hi> 3.19.4.</note>

D.</hi> who though they ſpeake but only vpon one or two places, yet it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the like muſt be vnderſtood in the whole Epiſtle. One word in <hi>chap. 3.19.</hi> miſ-tranſlated in moſt vulgar tranſlations drawes many men awry; <hi>Serueth.</hi> Neither
<pb facs="tcp:16702:3"/> the Greeke nor any Latine tranſlation hath it. But grant the word must needs come in to make vp the ſenſe; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how it can be ſenſibly in the preſent tenſe, but rather in the preterimperfect tenſe, ſeeing it is a queſtion, and the anſwer to it is in the preterimperfect tenſe plainly, as both <hi>Bezaes</hi> note, and others expound it. Not vnlike to this is in <hi>Rom. 3.20. commeth,</hi> or <hi>is,</hi> which being read <hi>came,</hi> or <hi>was,</hi> of the time paſt, maketh the ſenſe good: otherwiſe I cannot vnderſtand the words: for the time it is aduerſe to <hi>Now</hi> that followeth immediatly after, and therefore cannot be the ſame. Another thing in this Epiſtle is worth noting, that the Apoſtle <hi>cap. 4.1.</hi> by the <hi>Heire in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> meaneth the Synagogue or Church of the Iewes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, or the Iewes themſelues, and by full age he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Church of Chriſt ſince his death, or Chriſtians themſelues.

Luther</hi> not well vnderſtanding this expoſition, but generally taking the nonage of the heire to be the ſtate of the vnregenerate, and the full age to be the comming of Chriſt in ſpirit to any man, concludes the end of the Law to be at the comming of Chriſt into any mans heart, though on the ſame <hi>Gal. 4.1.</hi> he acknowledgeth an end of the Law at the comming of Chriſt, but doth not fully handle it ſo. Whereas it is plaine that the Apoſtles meaning was ſo: For he writ to the Churches of Galatia, which were in a ſort fallen from Chriſt, <hi>Calv. in Gal. 1.2.</hi> and not particularly to them alone that were true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as he did to the <hi>Romans, Epheſians, Philippians,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Neither did he diſtinguiſh betweene the true beleeuers and others, but writ to them that profeſſed

            <p>Many other arguments might be drawne from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the Law, and the all-ſufficiencie of the Goſpel, &amp; the true difference betweene them, &amp; the worthineſſe of Chriſt before <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; from the doctrine of Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: which for breuity ſake I omit: they will follow vpon the due conſideration of theſe things which I haue ſet down; yet for your further ſatisfaction I refer you to <hi>Muſculus Common places,</hi> in many places therof: but more ſpecially in the place of the Law, and moſt ſpecially <hi>Of the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law of Moſes. Of the Couenant of the
<pb facs="tcp:16702:5"/> difference of the Old and New Teſtament.</hi> And afore, <hi>Of the abrogation of the Lawiſh Sabbath,</hi> on the fourth Commandement. And to <hi>Zanchius in loco quinto theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logico ex cap. 2. ad Epheſ. verſ. 14, 15, de legis Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicae abrogatione,</hi> where he diſputeth the point very fully, yet he doth not plainly expound the places that ſeeme to contradict it, of which I will giue you a taſte. That of <hi>Matth. 5.</hi> cannot bee vnderſtood of the forme of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, but of the matter of it, or of the Law of Nature, for it cannot be denied but that the matter of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue being the Law of nature, is in force as it is the Law of nature and vnderſtood philoſophically: but how it can be in force theologically vnderſtood (for that is our queſtion in hand) being we haue no warrant in Scripture for it, but the contrary, I cannot ſee.</p>
            <p>For the other place <hi>Rom. 3.</hi> by the context it may be and is to be vnderſtood of the whole Law as well Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall as any other, and the ſame for the time paſt, but how the Morall law alone can be there vnderſtood, I maruell what ſhould moue any man to thinke ſo. See <hi>Eraſ Parap.</hi> on it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Eraſmus Paraphraſts</hi> on the new Teſtament you may finde much vpon this point: The booke though comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be had in Churches is too much neglected: bookes of farre meaner qualitie are much eſteemed. <hi>Luther</hi> on the Galatians hath much, for he ſaith in two places at the leaſt, that all Lawes are aboliſhed by Chriſt, page <hi>176. b. 177. a. 223. a.</hi> Yea the <hi>10.</hi> Commandements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and the like ſaith <hi>Beza</hi> on <hi>2. Cor. 3.11.</hi> Others are inforced to acknowledge it, though their iudgements be againſt it, for it ſo ſtands in their way that they cannot auoid it. All that any man can ſay againſt this doctrine is, that the Morall law or the Decalogue is perpetuall in nature, ſauing the fourth Commandement, no man denies it, but where the perpetuitie of it in diuinitie is to be found in Scripture would I faine ſee: For the holy Ghoſt in the new Teſtament doth not exact naturall precepts ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:16702:6"/> the Decalogue is,<note place="margin">Aug. de ſpirit. &amp; liter. cap. <hi>14.</hi> In decem praeceptis excepta Sabbati obſervatione, dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur mihi quid non ſit obſervandum à Chriſtiano.</note> for that is fulfilled in one word <hi>Loue, Gal. 5.14.</hi> But the exhortation is to the workes of the Spirit, none of which are properly commanded in the Decalogue.</p>
            <p>I forgot to illuſtrate the concluſion of my fifth ſection afore with a familiar <hi>Simile,</hi> which here I will adde. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the lawes of <hi>Venice</hi> to be the ſame for the moſt part with the lawes of <hi>England:</hi> And yet if in <hi>England</hi> the bookes of the Venetian lawes ſhould be brought out and read, either to condemne or acquit a man accuſed, or to giue direction for order and gouernment here with vs, I thinke few men in <hi>England</hi> would hold themſelues bound by vertue of thoſe lawes or booke in any ſuch manner.</p>
            <p>One other <hi>Simile</hi> to illuſtrate the generall point: <hi>2 Pet. 1.19.</hi> The Apoſtle likeneth the Prophets to lights ſhining in darke places, meaning as I ſuppoſe the Moone, Stars, or candles in the night till a greater light appeare: And <hi>Malachi 4.2.</hi> Chriſt is termed the <hi>Sunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> ſo when this Sunne is riſen, neither Moone nor Starres are ſeene, and candles are of no vſe. And <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius</hi> in <hi>Iſai. 2.5.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Stultitia erit, in meridie lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernis eſſe addictos, quibus Sol, ſi non ignavi eſſemus, lucerer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, I wiſh that all men, eſpecially Diuines, would take paines rightly to vnderſtand the <hi>Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie, the difference of the Law and the Goſpell, and of the old and new Teſtament, and of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of both;</hi> And ſo <hi>the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I might a little illuſtrate my ſecond ſection with a word or two. If a man make two Teſtaments or Wills, it is knowne to euery man that the latter, and that whereupon he died is only in force, and the former is not.</p>

Beſides all this, ſeeing Chriſt in this firſt verſe, is as you alledge, oppoſed to the Prophets, you may by as good reaſon conclude, that all the ſacred Records of the Prophets are now cancelled and caſt out of the Church by the comming of Chriſt, in whom they were accompliſhed, as that, the Morall Law firſt written by the finger of God, is now vtterly aboliſhed, becauſe by Chriſt himſelfe it was fulfilled, and if by that which followeth <hi>[the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and earth muſt vaniſh, but he remaine]</hi> you meane, that the Morall Law muſt needs vtterly periſh if Chriſt remaine, remember then I pray, that Chriſt himſelfe hath ſaid the like of the Morall Law, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſaid of him; <hi>Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe, but one iot or tittle of the Law ſhall not paſſe, till all be fulfilled.</hi> Vpon which words, <note n="q" place="margin">Bulling. in Mat. <hi>5.18.</hi>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16702:60"/> Secondly, that the precepts and prohibitions of the Decalogue, doe binde all Chriſtians to allegeance and obedience. Thirdly, that a Chriſtian doing any thing againſt the Decalogue or Morall Law, ſinneth more grieuouſly vnder the Goſpell, than any Iew commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame ſinnes vnder the Law.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16702:61"/> and required, according to the precepts of the Morall Law] then is a Chriſtian bound in the daies of the Goſpell, to the obedience of the Morall Law: And if a Chriſtian be not freed from the obedience of true righteouſneſſe [and the rule of true righteouſneſſe be the Morall Law] (as all Diuines doe agree, and as Chriſt and his Apoſtles haue taught the Churches) then is a Chriſtian bound in the daies of the Goſpell, to yeeld obedience vnto the Morall Law. Now if you be pleaſed to lay all theſe together, the reckoning will ariſe to another and a greater ſumme, than you imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or expected, at this time and place; and that, not to feed your fancy and ſerue your humour, for the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abrogation of the whole Morall Law, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the contrary truth, for ratifying and eſtabliſhing thereof amongſt Chriſtians, in the daies of the Goſpell.

He is farre from condemning the vſe of the Morall Law; you are eager and hot in purſuing of it euen vnto death and vtter deſtruction: He will allow and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the vſe of it, and them that vſe it too, for cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing children or nouices in religion; there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man woman nor childe, younger nor elder, that can intreat you, to giue them leaue or liberty, to haue

And here by the way I pray you be aduertiſed, that howſoeuer this allegation be ſufficient to confute your opinion, yet doe not I ſo alledge it, as altogether to approue it, nor can I ſo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke or ſpeake of the Decalogue or Morall Law, as here your <hi>Muſculus</hi> doth write of it: for whereas he will not allow it any other place in the Church but in the Catechiſme, nor the explication thereof to be needfull for any but for nouices and children; I am of opinion, that the miniſtry and induſtry of the moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, religious, and beſt experienced Diuines, may well and worthily, profitably and comfortably be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in ſeeking and ſearching out the infinite and admirable wiſdome, together with other the deepe things of God, which are hid in the Morall Law, and that not only for their owne priuate inſtruction, but for the edification of the ripeſt and chiefeſt of Gods children. And whoſoeuer he be, that thinks ſo little and ſo light knowledge of the Morall Law will ſerue the turne, that it is to be held only as milke for babes, and not as ſtrong meat for men of riper age, I am afraid that as he doth depreſſe and abaſe the Law of God more than is meet, ſo doth he aduance himſelfe too high aboue his pitch, being raſhly puft vp in his fleſhly minde, and knowing little or nothing in this particular as he ought to know.

Firſt, did not Chriſt come to deſtroy this outward forme of the Morall Law? Secondly, did <hi>Zanchius</hi> euer ſay otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Zanch. in Epheſ. <hi>2.</hi> de abrogat. Legis.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt came not to deſtroy the outward forme, i. the circumſtances, and acceſſories of the Morall Law? Thirdly, doth not <hi>Zanchius</hi> auouch euidently the cleane contrary? Fourthly, why then doe you blame his expoſition, as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16702:64"/> eſtabliſhing the forme as well as the matter of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law? Fiftly, how doe you that haue ſo long ſtood out againſt the Morall Law, for the abſolute abrogating of it, euen the whole Law, and wholly too, now ſo come in vnto <hi>Zanchius,</hi> and others that haue ſtood for it, that you yeeld them and vs the whole ſubſtance and matter of the Morall Law to be in force ſtill, and content your ſelfe only to carry away the ſhadowes, acceſſories, and circumſtances of the ſame, to feed your fancy with an idle and adle conceit of a glorious victory. <hi>Egregiam verò laudem &amp; ſpolia ampla tuliſti.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Virgil.

I wiſh it were ſo well and no otherwiſe with you, that the Lord would giue you ſuch a teachable and tractable heart and ſpirit, that whereas you haue read <hi>Zanchius, Luther, Caluine,</hi> and other Orthodoxall Writers, with a minde and purpoſe to draw them to your error, and ſo to call them in, both as witneſſes and counſellors againſt the Morall Law, you may ſo be conuinced your ſelfe, by the euidence of the truth which they deliuer, and the force of the reaſons which they render, for the continuance and maintenance of the Morall Law, that if hitherto you haue not, yet henceforth you may, renounce your error, and embrace the truth with them.</p>

For I demand, Firſt, may it not now be denied, that the whole Morall Law is wholly abrogated, as you affirme, ſeeing it cannot be denied but the matter of the Morall Law is yet of force, as you now confeſſe? Secondly, if the matter of the Morall Law be of force at this preſent, as the Law of Nature commanding; is not the forme alſo in force by our conformity thereunto in obeying? And thirdly, if both matter and forme (the eſſentiall parts of the Morall Law) be yet continued, [as it is the Law of Nature] that is, a naturall rule of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe to ſuch as are in the ſtate of nature; is it therefore ſo depriued of all ſpirituall force and vſe, that it cannot be alſo a ſpirituall rule of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, to ſuch as are called to the eſtate of grace?

Surely, if true beleeuers haue now no other benefit, nor vſe of the Morall Law, but as it is the Law of Nature and Philoſophically vnderſtood; then is the Law (written ſo diſtinctly by <hi>Moſes,</hi> a penman of the Holy Ghoſt) not written,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4. 2 Tim. 3.16.</note> as other Scriptures are, for our learning.

If you be pleaſed to take the light of this compariſon in your hand, it will ſhew you (if your ſight be any thing like) both the vanity and weakneſſe of your concluſion in your fift ſection, and the darkneſſe and obſcurity of your ſorry Simile, which you haue brought to ſet a fairer gloſſe vpon the ſame.</p>
               <p>Your other Simile which you bring to illuſtrate the generall point, hath I acknowledge much more light in it, if by the generall point you meane the Law giuen by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it ſtands in oppoſition againſt the Goſpell, according to that of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law was giuen by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but grace and truth by Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> For whether you vnderſtand the Ceremoniall or Morall Law, or the Prophets, either as interpreters of the ſame, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers of the good things to come imported by any of them,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> it is moſt true (as you alledge out of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.)

                  <note place="margin">Mal. 4.2. Iſa. 9.1, 2. Ioh. 1.17.</note> So then we ſay, <hi>They that ſate in darkneſſe haue ſeene a great light, and vnto them that ſate in the ſhadow of death, hath the light
